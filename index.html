        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> I was 13 and in junior high school the year that Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. <br/>
          I recall learning to type and playing Oregon Trail on the Apple Computers at my school, and all library research was done with the Dewey Decimal System. <br/>
          In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML. I was a Sophomore in high school. Needless to say, web design was not yet an elective.<br/>
          My senior year, there was a computer in the house. I didn't know how to use it. My Dad used it for work, I think we were online, but I didn't know how to use it.<br/>
          Somehow, my highschool education ended right as the WWW was beginning, and my interests were not computer science related, so it took me a long time to find myself here, learning web development.<br/>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Adobe Creative Suite</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I feel like I grew up alongside the WWW, but never became friends with it. <br/>
           I remember getting my first email address, and my first laptop, but never took the time to learn these skills.<br/>
           I can say without hesitation that I am ready, interested and engaged to learn this craft.
